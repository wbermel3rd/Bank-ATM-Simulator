This program simulates a Bank's ATM through a text input system.

Instructions to run code:

- Download all .java files
- Open them in an editor or IDE
- Press run
- If code has been run by the user before, then a BankClients.txt file should already exist.
  Otherwise, a new one will be created. This file will contain the randomly generated bank account
  numbers as well as the corresponding pin numbers.
- After running the code, the user has the option to enter an account number or create a new account,
  then input the pin for the existing/newly created account, respectively. 
- After successfully accessing the account, the balance of the account will be displayed, and the
  user then has the option to withdraw from or deposit to the account, or exit, which will stop
  the program.
- If either withdraw or deposit is selected, the user will then be prompted to input the amount
  that they would like to withdraw or deposit. The user cannot withdraw more than is in the account.
- These actions can be repeated until the user decides to exit.

Full design and implementation by William Bermel III.
Made for NYIT's Computer Programming II class in Spring 2022.

May revisit later on to add the options to redisplay the balance, and switch accounts without exiting.
